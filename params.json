The first serious programming language was C#. Making experiments through creating simple programs with Windows Forms I got pretty ready to quit middle school after 9th grade to join Moscow University College Of IT. I'm going through the last semester right now and doing my [diploma project in full stack JavaScript](github.com/nuc134r/school-portal).\r\n\r\n### Skills\r\nTBC.",
