<p>I first touched code when I was 13 years old. The first serious programming language was C#. Making experiments through creating simple programs with Windows Forms I got pretty ready to quit middle school after 9th grade to join Moscow University College Of IT. I'm going through the last semester right now and doing my diploma project in full stack JavaScript.</p>
