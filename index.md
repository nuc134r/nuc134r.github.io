I first touched code when I was 13 years old. The first serious programming language was C#.

### Interests

I'm really interested in making things that solve people's problems but besides it I like playing acoustic guitar, juggling, biking, looking at old Soviet buildings, watching drama movies, listening to all kinds of music, getting up at noon, breeze summer mornings, hot summer days, warm summer nights, walking around alone, fidgeting, being really concentrated, knowing that I did something useful at the end of a day, making notes, when people laugh at my jokes, long winter bus rides, listening to stories, telling stories, wallpapers with lots of details to be explored over and over, getting to know people, green color and many other things.
